# Batched Gibbs Sampling for Community Detection in SBM
 Implementations of batched Gibbs samplers for community detection tasks as in the article by [Zhand and Zhou (2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320754673_Theoretical_and_Computational_Guarantees_of_Mean_Field_Variational_Inference_for_Community_Detection).
 Further extensions to a Dirichlet prior on the assignment probabilities, inspired by some methods presented by [Neal (2000)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390653).
